I diddnt realize the idiotic mistake I made until about 10 mins ago (10:40 pm on the 26th).
I DO KNOW JAVASCRIPT, AND I AM COMFORTABLE TRAVERSING THE DOM AND MODIFYING ELEMENTS.
In order to practice for the dev test, I made this "cheat sheet" the night prior to have with me during the test
I have no idea why I diddnt realize that you were expecting me to use javascript to make the border..
Anyway, I hope you see this, and I hope I diddnt completely screw up my chance of working at Parkfield!
